### Task_1.2_a:
The folder contains all the files (c-file, Proteus file, hex file) for sub-task to increment the count on SSD with 1sec delay between each count using timer interrupt method. In this timer 0 of PIC is used to generate 1 sec delay between each count.

### Task_1.2_b :
The folder contains all the files (c-file, Proteus file, hex file) for sub-task to increment the count on SSD with 1sec delay between each count using timer interrupt method and also run LED pattern 1,2,3,3,2,1 using polling method but the problem occurs in this code is that if both the conditions are run simultaneously that only LED pattern runs correctly. If LED section is commented then SSD section works correctly.
